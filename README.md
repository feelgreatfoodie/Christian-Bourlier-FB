This project is an opportunity to learn Angular with a forward look to making it a SPA that aggregates posts from various user sites (e.g. LinkedIn, GitHub, Facebook, Twitter) and displays them on a personal branding site

The plan is to extend this app as a plug-in to personal sites, which would add an aspect for aggregations of public posts made by the individual. It would be an opportunity to demonstrate a personal brand via actual public postings... or possibly even a tool for recruiters that would like to get a comprehensive picture of potential candidates without visiting every site under the web independently.

## To run on your local computer
Fork and clone repository  
Run npm install in your console  
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
